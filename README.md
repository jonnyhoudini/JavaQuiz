## Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz
## Polymorphism

What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

It comes from the Greek meaning 'many changes'.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

It is possible to make different classes share the same type. For example, the Student and Teacher classes can both share the IPerson type if they implement the IPerson interface. 

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

Inheritance and Interfaces are two ways of using polymorphism. 

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

Inheritance - only 1. Interfaces - as many as you like.

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

Composition and Aggregation
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

Composition is when an object is made up of one or more other objects.

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

The car object is composed of an engine and ignition objects and those methods can now be accessed by the car.

Give a difference between composition and aggregation?

Aggregation is a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. In composition the child is entirely encapsulated in the parent object.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?

You have all the functionality of using inheritance but it offers more flexibility.

When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

All the child objects are destroyed too.

When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

They live on.
